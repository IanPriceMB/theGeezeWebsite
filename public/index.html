        <h2>The History of the Geeze pt.1</h2>
        <div class="part1">
            <p>
                The Geeze (/thuu G’ eez/, Gaian 6 -  December c. 5.375 million BCE – is a Gaian born artist, musician, writer and Twitch streamer.          
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the story goes; a small, nubile and exceedingly handsome child, was born to Fran and Chico Margate. At the time the young family 
                lived in what would become Ohio, where Fran and Chico performed lively Irish Step dancing on street corners for their daily sustenance. 
                Fran was descended from a proprietary branch of hominid, the dancing simiae, whilst Chico’s line remains undetected using modern forensic anthropology. 
                It is assumed that the two met during the great diaspora trekking from Afrika to North America then onto the British Isles and then back again to North America. 
                (Citroque commeare). A trip that legend says took them 3 months in a birch bark canoe outfitted with a small outboard engine and a collection of dried foods they 
                had purchased from the local outdoor retailer.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the quite nearly immaculate birth of the Geeze, as neither Fran nor Chico were capable of procreation due to the lack of upkeep on 
                the filter of their respective gene pools, passers-by were overjoyed when baby Geeze, at 7 months of age, began to dance with his parents 
                as well. He was especially gifted at hip hop and Latin ballroom. Many a day was spent by baby Geeze, wowing the crowd with his expertise 
                a’foot not to mention the addition of his own operatic baritone which came in his third year, singing children’s songs. These formative 
                years of Geeze’s musical training are often referred to by academicians as The Early Daze.
            </p>
            <p>
                Year three was seminal for The Geeze as It was then that he was discovered by Tim Tater of Tim Tater’s Tots, who procured for Geeze, 
                his own radio show - unfortunately dancing on the radio never became quite the hit he had imagined. Not to mention that a full baritone 
                rendition of spirited children’s songs seemed a bit disturbing to many adults. Tim, Geeze’s agent, became disconsolate with his stars lack 
                of success and was forced to let him go. Some years later, whilst being interviewed in Idaho, Tim lamented that he should never have let him 
                go, and that he’d had to sell his potato farm to make ends meet.    
            </p>
            <p>
                After the loss of the radio program, Geeze went into a deep depression and began to skip out on practicing with his family. He started to smoke 
                cigars and hang out at the local arcades with a peculiarly dirty and unkept crowd on hangers on with big bulging pockets, presumably full of nickels 
                or other coinage with which to operate the games in the arcade. It was while engaged with, what became known as the Bushnell Dabney Ruffians, that Geeze 
                began to cultivate a more diverse appreciation for music. He later said in a famous 1993 interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, that, ‘Dude, I was like, you 
                know totally tripped out by Asteroids – all those sounds, man.
            </p>
            <p>
                Geeze left home at seven years of age to attend school in Havana and to try to figure out why Cuban cigars are so much better than any others.  
                It was while living in Cuba that Geeze developed his fascination with Cuban jazz and formed his own 8-person band, The Poi Oreja Trio. This was a lively 
                group of gifted pre-adolescents, who when not performing were often overheard discussing whether or not suffering was a necessary part of the human condition. 
                After some years of performing in dive bars and back alley bistros, as well as the onset of puberty, Geeze gave it all up to get back to nature by moving 
                to the U.K. and herding stray cats. This forms the beginning of the second formative stage of Geeze’s life, the Rockabilly Era. For some years he made quite 
                good at herding, having developed the process of cat shearing and selling the accumulated detritus for yarn making. He lived well in a small semi-detached, 
                thatched, bungalow in Midsomer. Alas, and much to his chagrin, Midsomer became home to sporadic outbreaks of violence by and against old people and the clergy, 
                as well as weekly poetry slams which continued until the first of a series of invasions through the Isle of Thanet. This violence led directly to the English 
                Civil War (1642 – 1651) and which wasn’t civil at all. Geeze moved to Huntingdon and took the side of the Roundheads, as he had developed a proclivity for circles 
                during the cat shearing process which requires that the shearer chase the cat around in a small ring-shaped structure making the cat dizzy and causing it to sploot 
                like a corgi and then to give in to the actual shearing. Many photographs of furless felines are stored in the archives of Midsomer, one just must know where to look. 
                Also, Geeze knew Oliver Cromwell’s half-brother, Berti. When the war ended, and Geeze was faced with either moving back to the violence of Midsomer or having his 
                head on a pike after a decidedly hostile reaction from Oliver after a rousing game of Scrabble, Geeze left the country and returned to North America.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Geeze spent much of his time developing his ideas about music whilst attending numerous schools including Ma Baker’s, Julliard, and Smith College. Later, 
                after his schooling was finished and Geeze had written his first music book, Swift Ruby and React; Pythons do Rust, Geeze became not only a full stack developer, 
                but also the vocal coach for the Hungarian National Men’s Kazoo Band and Water Polo Team. He was let go after several members nearly drowned practicing Mozart’s 
                “Requiem Lacrimosa.” Several further stops were made in Geeze’s quest for a music career, including the Cleveland Symphony, the New Rochelle Fire Department Marching 
                Troubadours and lastly a small bohemian, British band in late 1950’s Hamburg which Geeze left behind recognizing that they would never amount to much.
